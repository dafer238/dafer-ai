# dafer-ai

A 16-week deep dive into Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning,
with an emphasis on **first principles**, **physical intuition**, and **real-world systems**.

## Focus Areas
- Optimization & learning dynamics
- Machine learning from scratch
- Deep learning with PyTorch
- Transformers and attention
- Applications to:
  - Quantitative finance
  - Energy systems
  - Thermodynamics
  - Industrial engineering

## Structure
Each week has:
- Theory notes
- From-scratch implementations
- Framework-based implementations
- Mini-projects tied to real systems

## Philosophy
AI is treated as:
> Optimization under uncertainty in complex systems

No copy-paste. No magic. Everything explained.

## Capstone
The capstone project integrates forecasting, uncertainty estimation,
and deployment in a real-world-inspired domain.
